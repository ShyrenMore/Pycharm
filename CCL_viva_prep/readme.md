## Questions on Cloud computing

### What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

### Features/characteristics of cloud computing 

1) Agility
The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them–from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more. <br> You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.

2) Elasticity
With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.

3) Cost savings
The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. 

4) Deploy globally in minutes
With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.

### NIST cloud computing model

National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) states that Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interactive.

### Essential Cloud Computing Characteristics:

**On-demand self-service:** consumers can unilaterally provision computing capabilities as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
**Broad network access:** capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanism that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms.
**Resources pooling:** The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand
**Rapid elasticity:** capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
**Measured service:** cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.

#### Service Models

**Software as a Service (Saas):** SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. 

**Platform as a Service (PaaS):** PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar.

### Cloud computing architechture

The cloud architecture is divided into 2 parts i.e.

- Frontend :
Frontend of the cloud architecture refers to the client side of cloud computing system. Means it contains all the user interfaces and applications which are used by the client to access the cloud computing services/resources. For example use of a web browser to access the cloud plat form.
Client Infrastructure – Client Infrastructure refers to the frontend components. It contains the applications and user interfaces which are required to access the cloud platform.

- Backend : 
Backend refers to the cloud itself which is used by the service provider. It contains the resources as well as manages the resources and provides security mechanisms. Along with this it includes huge storage, virtual applications, virtual machines, traffic control mechanisms, deployment models etc.

- Layers present in backend : <br>
**Application** –
Application in backend refers to a software or platform to which client accesses. Means it provides the service in backend as per the client requirement.<br>
**Service** –
Service in backend refers to the major three types of cloud based services like SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. Also manages which type of service the user accesses.<br>
**Cloud Runtime** –
Runtime cloud in backend refers to provide of execution and runtime platform/environment to the virtual machine.<br>
**Storage** –
Storage in backend refers to provide flexible and scalable storage service and management of stored data.<br>
**Infrastructure** –
Cloud Infrastructure in backend refers to hardware and software components of cloud like it includes servers, storage, network devices, virtualization software etc.<br>
**Management** –
Management in backend refers to management of backend components like application, service, runtime cloud, storage, infrastructure, and other security mechanisms etc.<br>
**Security** –
Security in backend refers to implementation of different security mechanisms in the backend for secure cloud resources, systems, files, and infrastructure to end-users.<br>
**Internet** –
Internet connection acts as the medium or a bridge between frontend and backend and establishes the interaction and communication between frontend and backend.<br>

### Limitations of Cloud: 

**Cloud downtime**
- The cloud, like any other IT set-up, can experience technical problems such as reboots, network outages and downtime. These events can incapacitate business operations and processes, and can be damaging to business.
- You should plan for cloud downtime and business continuity. Try to minimise the impact and the number of outages and ensure the maximum level of service availability for your customers and staff. 

**Limited control**
- The cloud service provider owns, manages and monitors the cloud infrastructure. You, as the customer, will have minimal control over it. You will be able to manage the applications, data and services operated on the cloud, but you won't normally have access to key administrative tasks, such as updating and managing firmware or accessing server shell.
- In order to mitigate risks, it may help to carry out a risk assessment before you hand over any control to a service provider. Once you have a clear idea of the risks, you will be able to weigh them against the advantages of cloud computing.

**Cost unpredictability** due to fluctutating demands
